## About this Code Example
This project provides a practical code example of a **Food Delivery** system implemented using the **Modular Monolith** architecture with **.NET**.

It demonstrates how to build a scalable and maintainable application using modern software engineering practices, including:
- **Modular Monolith Architecture**: Organizing the system into independent modules.
- **Vertical Slice Architecture**: Grouping code by features to minimize coupling.
- **CQRS Pattern**: Separating command (write) and query (read) responsibilities.
- **Domain Driven Design (DDD)**: aligning the software model with the business domain.
- **Event Driven Architecture**: Facilitating asynchronous communication between modules using an In-Memory Bus (or external brokers).

💡 **Purpose**: This application is a technical demonstration. It focuses on implementing robust architecture patterns rather than being a fully-featured commercial product. It shows how modules like *Catalogs*, *Orders*, *Customers*, etc., interact within a single deployable unit while maintaining strict boundaries.
